# Administer Forms Pro

Microsoft Forms Pro is a simple yet comprehensive survey solution that builds on the current survey-creation experience of Microsoft Forms in Office 365. It has added functionality that supports businesses seeking to transform customer, product, and employee experiences.

Forms Pro has robust tooling to support deeper analytics and insights with integration across your tools, such as Common Data Service, Microsoft Power Platform, and the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. With Forms Pro, you can send branded surveys to customers with your company's look and feel. Survey distribution is simpler with the built-in email composer. You can also automate sending surveys with Microsoft Flow and leverage preconfigured Microsoft Flow templates to integrate with the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365.

Forms Pro allows you to work with classic forms and quizzes, and create new ones. The classic forms and quizzes open in their respective interfaces within the Forms Pro environment. This gives you the ability to work with surveys and classic forms together. For information on how to create classic forms in Forms Pro, see [Create a classic form](create-classic-form.md).

By default, Forms Pro is enabled for all users in your tenant. As an administrator, you can turn off Forms Pro for all users in the tenant. If a few users want to opt out, you can advise them to opt out of Forms Pro. This will not affect other users in the tenant.

## Opt out of Forms Pro

1. Sign in to Forms Pro.

2. Select your username from the upper-right corner of the page.

3. Select **Switch to Forms**. When you switch to Forms, you are redirected to the Microsoft Forms experience and are no longer able to edit surveys.

## Enable Forms Pro for users with Dynamics 365 enterprise licenses

Microsoft Forms Pro is included as part of the Dynamics 365 enterprise license. A tenant with a Dynamics 365 enterprise license has 2,000 responses per month included at the tenant level (irrespective of how many seats the tenant has). To purchase additional responses, see [Purchase additional responses for Microsoft Forms Pro users in a Dynamics 365 tenant](purchase.md#purchase-additional-responses-for-microsoft-forms-pro-users-in-a-dynamics-365-tenant).

To enable Forms Pro:

1. Sign in to Forms.

2. Select your username from the upper-right corner of the page.

3. Select **Switch to Forms Pro**.

## Turn off Forms Pro

If you want to turn off Forms Pro in your tenant, disable the Azure Active Directory self-service sign-up. For more information on self-service sign-up, see [What is self-service sign-up for Azure Active Directory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-self-service-signup).
