## Administrator settings

Following are the available administrator settings.

### Record names of people in your org

Use this setting to capture the names of survey responders. By default, **Record names by default** is selected. Clear this check box if you want survey responses within your organization to remain anonymous. However, you can enable or disable this setting within individual surveys also. More information: [Only people in my organization can respond](invite-settings.md#only-people-in-my-organization-can-respond)

### Phishing protection

Use this setting to set an automatic scan of surveys within your organization for phishing detection. By default, **Add internal phishing protection** is selected. Clear this check box if you don't want to enable phishing scans for surveys within your organization.

### Survey incentive

Use this setting if you want to allow survey authors in your organization to add Microsoft Rewards incentives to their surveys. By default, **Allow survey authors to add incentives to surveys created using Microsoft Forms Pro** isn't selected. Select this check box to allow incentives to be added to surveys to help increase the response rate. More information: [Offer survey incentives to your respondents](survey-incentives.md)
