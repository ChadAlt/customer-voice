## Administrator settings

Following are the available administrator settings:

### Record names of people in your org

This setting allows you to capture names of survey responders. By default, **Record names by default** is selected. Clear this option if you want survey responses within your organization to remain anonymous by default. However, you can enable or disable this setting within individual surveys also. More information: [Only people in my organization can respond](invite-settings.md#only-people-in-my-organization-can-respond)

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Record names setting](media/record-names-setting.png "Record names setting")

### Phishing protection

This setting allows you to set an automatic scan of survey within your organization for phishing detection. By default, **Add internal phishing protection** is selected. Clear this option if you don't want phishing scans for surveys within your organization.

### Survey incentive

This setting allows you to choose if you want to allow survey authors in your organization to add Microsoft Rewards incentives to their surveys. By default, **Allow survey authors to add incentives to surveys created using Microsoft Forms Pro** is not selected. Select this option to allow incentives to be added to survey for increasing the response rate. More information: [Offer survey incentives to your respondents](survey-incentives.md)
