# Share a survey for collaborating

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

When you share a survey for collaborating, it remains in your profile, but other people can view and edit it through a special URL created for collaborators. At the top of the survey that you've shared, you'll see icons of the initials for each person making edits to the survey. When you share a survey, it is available in the **Shared with me** section on the home page.

Microsoft Forms Pro also displays contributor icons next to each section currently being edited.

1.  Open the survey you want to share for collaboration.

2.  On the **Create Questions** tab, select **Share** ![share the survey](media/share-survey.png "Share the survey") from the toolbar at the top of the page.

3.  Select **Get a link to view and edit**.
