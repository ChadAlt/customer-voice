# Send a survey QR code

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

You can generate a QR code for your recipients to scan on a phone or tablet to access the survey.

> [!NOTE]
> The survey link generated is a non-personalized link. You won't be able to record the respondent's name and whether the respondent has submitted only one response if you select **Anyone with the link can respond** in [survey settings](invite-settings.md).

1. Open the survey you want to send, and then select **Send** from the toolbar at the top of the page. 

2. Select **QR code**.

3. Select **Download**, and then share the QR code wherever your intended audience can scan it with a QR code scanner, such as on a mobile device.
