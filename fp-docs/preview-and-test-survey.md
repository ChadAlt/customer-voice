# Preview and test a survey

<!--note from editor:  List item #2: Suggest adding the graphic of the Preview icon after the word **Preview** in the sentence, and removing the screen shot that shows the other icons-->

<!--note from editor:  List item #2: add "of the page" after "at the top" if that is accurate-->

After you have created and edited a survey, preview and test it before distributing it to respondents:

1.  Open the survey you want to preview.

2.  On the **Create Questions** tab, select **Preview** from the toolbar at the top to see how your survey will look on a computer.
