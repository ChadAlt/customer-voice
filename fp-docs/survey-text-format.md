# Format text in a survey

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

You can customize the look of your survey by changing the font, font style, font size, and color of the text. You can apply formatting to the following elements:

- Survey title
- Survey description
- Question text
- Question subtitle
- Question options
- Section heading
- Section description
- Thank-you message
- Footer text
- Lower-left and lower-right labels for Net Promoter Score and Rating questions
- Statements for Likert questions

> [!NOTE]
> The text formatting capability isn't supported for options of Ranking and Likert questions.
