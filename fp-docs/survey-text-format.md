# Format text in a survey

You can customize the look of your survey by changing the font, font style, font size, and color of the text. You can apply formatting to the following elements:

- Survey title <!--Suggest "title" because it seems to be what the UI calls it ("Untitled survey") -->
- Survey description
- Question text
- Question subtitle
- Question options
- Section heading
- Section description
- Thank-you message
- Footer text
- Lower-left and lower-right labels for Net Promoter Score and Rating questions
- Statements for Likert questions

> [!NOTE]
> The text formatting capability isn't supported for the actual options a user selects for Ranking and Likert questions. <!--Edit suggested. I was confused by the use of "options" here compared to the list above.-->

**To format survey text**

1.	Open the survey in which you want to format text.
<!--Will the survey title and description show up here? Or is there a different step to follow for them?-->
2.	On the **Questions** tab, select the text that you want to format. The formatting toolbar appears.

3. Choose formatting for your survey text.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Apply text formatting](media/text-format.png "Apply text formatting")

In the following illustration, custom formatting has been applied to the survey title, description, questions, options for answering the questions, and the labels for the Net Promoter Score. <!--Edit okay? I was a bit confused by the reference to the "elements you selected earlier." Also - Maybe I shouldn't have added "and the labels for the Net Promoter Score"? I can't really tell whether the font for the labels has been changed.-->

> [!NOTE]
> To format the thank-you message and footer text, open the **Settings** pane, select the message or text, and then use the formatting toolbar. <!--Is this also how you modify the survey title and description? If so, can that be added here?--> More information: [Survey response options](invite-settings.md#survey-response-options)
