# View summary information for your survey

After you create your survey, adjust its settings, and share your survey with others, it's time to view the results and insights. Open the survey that you want to review, and then select the **Responses** tab.

On the **Overview** tab, you'll see summary data about your survey, such as number of invitations sent, number of responses received, Net Promoter Score (NPS), respondent sentiment, and survey insights. You can select **Invitations** or **Responses** to get more details.

The following statistics are displayed:

- **Invitations**: Total number of survey invitations sent.

- **Responses**: Total number of survey responses received.

- **NPS**: The NPS of the survey. The scoring for the NPS-type question is based on a 0 to 10 scale. The respondents are grouped based on the scores as follows:
    - **Detractors** are those who respond with a score of 0 to 6.
    - **Passives** are those who respond with a score of 7 to 8.
    - **Promoters** are those who respond with a score of 9 to 10.
    
    NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.

- **Sentiment**: Average sentiment of the respondents: positive, neutral, or negative. For more information on sentiment calculation, see [Calculate sentiments from responses to text-based questions](create-new-survey.md#calculate-sentiments-from-responses-to-text-based-questions).

- **Latest insights**: Correlation and sentiment are displayed based on the survey responses.
