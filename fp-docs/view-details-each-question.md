# View details for each question

You can view details for each question in the survey by going to **Responses** &gt; **Question-wise analysis**. A graphical representation of the responses is displayed. The visualizations on the **Question-wise analysis** page are all connected to each other. What this means is that if you select one or more values in one visualization, other visualizations that use that same value will change based on your selection.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Question responses summary](media/ques-responses.png "Question responses summary")

To see the name of each respondent and his or her responses to each question, select **More details**. The **Detailed Question Analysis** page opens with the detailed information.
