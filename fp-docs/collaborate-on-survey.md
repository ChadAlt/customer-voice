# Collaborate on a survey

You can have multiple people collaborate on the structure and layout of surveys. When you share a survey to collaborate, you create a special link which allows others to view and make changes to the design of a survey you started. All contributors to your survey can also view, edit, and delete responses. Contributors can also share the survey with others by sending them the survey collaborate link. Contributors can also distribute surveys via survey email.
