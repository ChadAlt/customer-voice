# Create a multilingual survey

You can create a multilingual survey by adding multiple languages to a single survey. You can then add translations for each language. This helps you increase your customer base and allows respondents to take the survey in their preferred language.

When you create a multilingual survey, respondents can choose their preferred language from the language selector at the upper-right corner of the survey.

3.	Once you've added translated text for all elements in the survey, select **Back** on the top-left corner of the page to go back to the survey editor.

4.	Repeat steps 2 - 3 to add translations for other languages.

After adding translations for all languages, you must preview the survey to see if everything works as expected. Select the language from the language selector at the upper-right corner of the survey.
