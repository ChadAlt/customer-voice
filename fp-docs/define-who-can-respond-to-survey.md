# Define who can respond to survey 

You can create two types of surveys:

-   Internal surveys to get responses about internal organization events such as an outing

-   External surveys to get responses from customers on things like case resolution or order closure feedback

For internal surveys, where you only want the people in your organization to respond, in the settings, select **Only people in my organization can respond.** This is the default option. When you select **Only people in my organization can respond**, respondents are required to sign in with their Office sign in credentials. You can also select whether the respondent’s name must be tracked and whether a respondent can respond multiple times.

To get responses from a wider audience outside of your organization, such as customers or partners, select **Anyone with the link can respond.**

> [!NOTE]
> - Currently for this preview, you can’t change the settings for Anyone with the link can respond. It is always set to record the respondent's name.
> - You can modify the authentication settings anytime, even after distributing the survey by email or other channels.
> - Anyone with the link address will be able to see and complete your survey. Be sure you're comfortable sharing the contents before changing this default option.
