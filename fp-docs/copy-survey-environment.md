# Copy a survey to another environment

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

You can create a copy of your survey in the same environment or in another environment. To copy a survey to another environment:

1. Sign in to Microsoft Forms Pro.

2. Find the survey you want to copy from the list of surveys, and then select **More form actions** (...) in the upper-right corner of the survey window.

    ![Survey more actions](media/survey-more-actions.png "Survey more actions")

3. Select **Copy**.

    ![Survey copy action](media/survey-copy.png "Survey copy action")

    Two options are displayed for copying the survey.

4. Select **Copy to**.

    ![Survey copy options](media/survey-copy-options.png "Survey copy options")

    A list of environments is displayed in a pane on the right side of the screen.

5. Select the environment to which you want to copy the survey.
