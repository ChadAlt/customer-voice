# Plan to create a survey

It's important to have a plan for configuring your surveys. Here are a few things to think about to help you create the right questions for your survey:

-   What's the purpose of your survey? For example, you might want to interact with your customers, promote new products or services, or measure customer satisfaction. If your goal is to measure something, what and how do you want to measure it?

-   How long do you want the survey to be? Keep in mind that longer surveys tend to have higher abandon rates. A good rule of thumb is to keep surveys shorter than five minutes, or no longer than 10 questions (depending on the type of question you ask).

-   How many mandatory questions are to be included in the survey? We recommend that you ask as few mandatory questions as possible.

-   How do you want to distribute your survey? For example, you want to distribute it through QR code or you want to automate.

-   How do you want to collaborate? For example, share the survey as a template or invite other people to collaborate.

-   How do you want to send invitations to your survey? For example, you might want to send individual emails or send a survey when a business event is triggered.
