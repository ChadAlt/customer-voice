# Best practices to create a survey

A few best practices will enable you to create a meaningful survey and gather good responses from your customers. You can then analyze those responses and act on them as best suits your organization. Some of the best practices for creating a survey are:

- **Define an objective**: Having an objective allows you to properly plan for your survey. This also allows you to identify what results you expect from your customers. You must know how you will use the responses to help you pick the right questions for your survey.

- **Keep the survey short**: If you create a survey that takes a long time to complete, you might reduce your response rate.

- **Create a logical flow of questions**: Ensure that your survey has a logical flow of questions to keep the respondents interested in the survey.

- **Organize the survey**: Group the related questions together.

- **Preview the survey**: After creating your survey, always preview it to check the overall flow of the survey and to catch any mistakes.

- **Mention expectations in the survey invitation**: In the survey invitation, ensure that you mention the estimated time to complete it and give a brief overview. This will help respondents submit their input within the expected timeframe.
