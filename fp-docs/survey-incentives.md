# Offer survey incentives to your respondents

As a survey owner, when you send surveys to your recipients, you expect to get a high response rate. The more survey responses received, the better insights you could get from the survey. However, survey response rate is typically low - on an average it might be as low as a single digit percentage. One of the best ways for increasing the response rate is by providing incentives for the recipient to respond to the survey. For example, a hotel company offers loyalty points to its guests when they respond to a customer satisfaction survey.

[Microsoft Forms Pro](https://formspro.microsoft.com) integrates with [Microsoft Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/rewards) to provide the capability of incentivizing a survey. When you create a survey and send it to your recipients, you can choose if incentives should be provided on completion of the survey or not. If survey incentives are enabled, a code is generated on completion of the survey. The code can then be redeemed by the respondent to take part in Microsoft Rewards sweepstakes.

> [!NOTE]
> - For this release, survey incentives are available only when a survey invitation is sent through email. More information for sending a survey invitation through email: [Send a survey by using email](send-survey-email.md)
> - The survey incentives capability is currently available only in the US region. Only the survey responders based in the US region will be able to view, access, and redeem the promo codes. 
> - Promo codes allow a responder to enter Microsoft Surface book sweepstake and are valid only till the end of the month. For detailed terms and condition, [click here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=530144).
> - Microsoft account is required to redeem the promo code. Each account can only redeem one promo code per day.

## Disable survey incentives in a tenant

As a tenant administrator, you can enable or disable survey incentives in a tenant to allow or restrict survey designers to offer survey incentives to their recipients. By default, survey incentives are enabled in a tenant.

To disable survey incentives:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

2. In the left pane, select **Settings** > **Services & add-ins**.

3. Select **Microsoft Forms**.

4. Under **Survey incentive**, turn the **Allow incentives to be added for surveys created using Forms Pro** toggle to **Off**.

When the survey incentives are turned off, the option of offer survey incentives in a survey invitation is also disabled. If the invitations are already sent with the survey incentive, a corresponding message is displayed after completing the survey.

## Enable survey incentives in survey invitation

When survey incentives are enabled by your administrator in your tenant, you can offer incentives to your respondents. Survey incentives can be enabled only while sending a survey through email. This gives you the control to enable incentives only for the required respondents.

1. Open the survey in which you want to enable survey incentives, and go to **Send survey** &gt; **Email**.

2. Below the email editor, select **Offer survey incentives to respondents (US only)**.

3. Optionally, select **Insert** > **Survey incentives information** to insert additional information about survey incentives in the email message. 

When a respondent completes a survey, a promo code is displayed. The respondent can then go to the Microsoft Rewards dashboard to redeem the code and enter sweepstakes.
