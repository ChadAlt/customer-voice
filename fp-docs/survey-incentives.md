# Survey incentives

As a survey owner, when you send surveys to your recipients, you expect to get a high response rate. The more survey responses received, the better insights you could get from the survey. However, survey response rate is typically low - on an average it might be as low as a single digit percentage. One of the best ways for increasing the response rate is by providing incentives for the recipient to respond to the survey. For example, a hotel company offers loyalty points to its guests when they respond to a customer satisfaction survey.

[Microsoft Forms Pro](https://formspro.microsoft.com) integrates with [Microsoft Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/rewards) to provide the capability of incentivizing a survey. When you create a survey and send it to your recipients, you can choose if incentives should be provided on completion of the survey or not. If survey incentives are enabled, a code is generated on completion of the survey. The code can then be redeemed by the respondent to take part in Microsoft Rewards sweepstakes.

> [!NOTE]
> - For this release, survey incentives are available only when a survey invitation is sent through email. More information for sending a survey invitation through email: [Send a survey by using email](send-survey-email.md)
