# Analyze survey invitations

A survey invitation record is created for each survey email that is sent, either manually or with Microsoft Flow. To see the survey invitations associated with a survey, go to **View Responses** &gt; **Overview**, and then select **Invitations** from the summary information. Survey invitation statistics and a list of survey invitations that were sent for a survey are displayed.

<!--note from editor--in sentence below, is "across the top" referring to "across the top of the screen"?-->

The following statistics are displayed across the top:

<!--note from editor: In list below: 1) What does "failed invitation" mean? That the email got bounced back? 2)What is "invitation status"--does that refer to "responded to, sent, failed, in-progress? 3) Unclear to me what "Invitation trend" is measuring. -->

- **Average turnaround time**: Average time between sending a survey invitation and receiving a survey response. The unanswered survey invites are ignored for this.

- **Failed invitations**: Number of failed invitations in the last week.

- **Invitation status**: A pie chart showing the distribution of survey invitations by status.

- **Invitation trend**: A line chart showing the distribution of survey invitation trends.

The list of survey invitations is displayed in grid format.

You can filter the grid to see responded to, sent, failed, and in-progress invitations. You can also search the invitations by a respondent’s name or email address.

To view details of a survey invitation, select an invitation in the grid. You’ll see the number of responses received for the invitation.

A summary of response details is also displayed for the survey invitation on the invitation details page.
