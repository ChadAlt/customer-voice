# Analyze survey invitations

A survey invitation record is created after for each survey email (manually or Microsoft Flow) sent for a survey. To see survey invitations of a survey, go to **View Responses** &gt; **Overview**, and then select **Invitations** from the summary information. The survey invitation statistics and the list of survey invitations sent for a survey are displayed.

The following statistics are displayed across the top:

- **Average turnaround time**: Average time between sending a survey invitation to receive a survey response for the invitation. The unanswered survey invites are ignored for this.

- **Failed invitations**: Number of failed invitations in the last week.

- **Invitation status**: A pie chart showing the distribution of survey invitation by status.

- **Invitation trend**: A line chart showing the distribution of survey invitation trend.

The list of survey invitations is displayed in the grid format.

You can filter the grid to see responded, sent, failed, and in progress invitations. You can also search the invitations by a respondent’s name or email address.

To view details of a survey invitation, select an invitation in the grid. You’ll see the number of responses received for the invitation.

A summary of response details is also displayed for the survey invitation on the invitation details page.
