# Analyze survey responses

A survey response record is created after a respondent submits a survey. To see survey responses of a survey, go to **View Responses** &gt; **Overview**, and then select **Responses** from the summary information. The survey response statistics and the list of survey responses received for a survey are displayed.

The following statistics are displayed across the top:

- **Average completion time**: Average time taken by a respondent from opening a survey to submitting the survey.

- **Response ratio:** Ratio of closed invites to the total number of invites.

- **Responses trend**: Number of survey responses received per day.

- **NPS distribution**: Distribution of the number of promoters, detractors, and passive supporters.

The list of survey responses is displayed in the grid format.

You can filter the grid to see all, tracked, or anonymous responses. You can also search the responses by a respondent’s name or email address.

To view details of a survey response, select a response in the grid. You’ll see the time taken by the respondent to complete the survey, NPS type, and sentiment. Response to each question in the survey is also displayed on the details page.
