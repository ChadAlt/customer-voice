# Purchase Microsoft Forms Pro

Microsoft Forms Pro license is based on the number of survey responses received per month. The capacity is measured at the tenant level.

- For a Dynamics 365 enterprise licensed tenant, 2000 responses are free and the customer can choose to purchase additional responses in bundles of $100 per 2000 responses.
- For an Office 365 licensed customer, there are no free responses included. The customer has to purchase responses in bundles of $100 per 2000 responses.
- If a tenant has Office 365 license, turning off license for Office Forms will also turn off Microsoft Forms Pro.

## Enable Forms Pro for users with Dynamics 365 enterprise licenses

If the consumed response capacity exceeds the annual capacity responses (for example, 24000 (12 X 2000 per month), or if $200 worth of additional capacity is purchased, then the annual capacity will be 48000) in any given month, then creating new surveys will be disabled. Existing surveys will continue to receive responses.
