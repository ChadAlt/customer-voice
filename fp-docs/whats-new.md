# What's new in Microsoft Forms Pro

Welcome to Microsoft Forms Pro. Here's a list of features we added or updated recently.

## December 2019 update

Following are the new and updated features in this release:

- **Proactive phishing prevention**: Microsoft Forms Pro now includes automated machine reviews to proactively detect malicious password collection in surveys. If you ask any question that requires a respondent to provide password, account information, or other security information, the survey is automatically blocked and can't be distributed. More information: [Proactive phishing prevention](create-new-survey.md#proactive-phishing-prevention)

## November 2019 update

Following are the new and updated features in this release:

- **Control display density of embedded surveys**: You can now select a display density for your embedded surveys. The display density controls the amount of white space and the size of the elements on the screen. More information: [Embed a survey in a webpage](embed-web-page.md)
  
- **Use survey variables to personalize surveys, email invitation, and collect contextual information**: Survey variables are introduced that will be used to personalize your surveys and email invitations. You can also use them while embedding your surveys to collect contextual information about your recipients. More information: [Personalize a survey](personalize-survey.md), [Personalize an email](send-survey-email.md#personalize-an-email), and [Embed a survey in a webpage](embed-web-page.md)

- **Power BI app template for customer service**: Provide end-to-end insights report that links customer feedback with the cases when you use Microsoft Forms Pro to send a survey after case resolution in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. More information: [Monitor customer satisfaction](customer-satisfaction-app.md)

- **Embed a survey in email**: You can now embed the first question of the survey in your email invitation, so that your survey respondent can answer directly from the email. More information: [Embed a survey in an email](send-survey-email.md#embed-survey-in-an-email)
