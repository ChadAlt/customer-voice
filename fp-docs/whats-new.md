# What's new in Microsoft Forms Pro

Welcome to Microsoft Forms Pro. Here's a list of features we added and updated recently.

## October 2019 update

Following are the new and updated features in this release:

- **Offer survey incentives**: You can now offer survey incentives to your respondents and increase the survey response rates. The survey responders can get a free chance to enter Microsoft Rewards sweepstakes and win a Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 plus a pair of Surface Headphones. More information: [Survey incentives](survey-incentives.md)

- **Power BI app template for customer service**: Provide an end-to-end insights report that links customer feedback with the cases when you use Microsoft Forms Pro to send a survey after case resolution in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. More information: [Monitor customer satisfaction](customer-satisfaction-app.md)

- **Embed survey in email**: You can now embed the first question of the survey in your email invitation, so that your survey respondent can answer directly from the email. More information: [Embed survey in an email](send-survey-email.md#embed-survey-in-an-email)

- **Hide question numbers**: You can now choose to hide question numbers in a survey. This behavior can be changed through survey settings. More information: [Select survey response and notification options](invite-settings.md#select-survey-response-and-notification-options)

- **Skip contact creation**: You can choose whether your respondent should be added as a contact in Common Data Service. This behavior can be changed through survey settings. More information: [Select survey response and notification options](invite-settings.md#select-survey-response-and-notification-options)

- **Switch to Forms Pro**: Dynamics 365 enterprise users can now enable Forms Pro through the option when opening the account pane after selecting the profile picture on the upper-right corner of the page. More information: [Enable Forms Pro for users with Dynamics 365 enterprise license](administer.md#enable-forms-pro-for-users-with-dynamics-365-enterprise-license)
 
- **Updated survey response form in Dynamics 365**: View complete information about the survey when opening the survey response from the Dynamics 365 activity timeline. The updated form now includes sentiment, NPS, and all questions-responses on the main form without navigating to different views.
 
- **Support for 11 option scale in Likert question type**: The Likert question type is now extended to support up to 11 scale options to provide you with more flexibility when designing your survey questions.
