# Share a survey to collaborate

When you share a survey to collaborate, it remains in your profile, but other people can view and edit it through that collaborate URL. At the top of the survey that you've shared, you'll see icons of the initials for each person making edits to the survey. When you share a survey, it is available in the **Shared with me** section on the home page.

Microsoft Forms also displays contributor icons next to each section currently being edited.

1.  Open the survey you want to share to collaborate.

2.  In the **Create Questions** tab, select **Share** from the toolbar at the top.

3.  Select **Get a link to view and edit**.
