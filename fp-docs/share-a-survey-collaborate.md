# Share a survey for collaborating

<!--note from editor:  In below sentence, suggest changing "view and edit it through that collaborate URL." to "view and edit it through the collaborators URL." -->

<!--note from editor:  In below sentence, is "home page" referring to Forms Pro home page?-->

When you share a survey for collaborating, it remains in your profile, but other people can view and edit it through that collaborate URL. At the top of the survey that you've shared, you'll see icons of the initials for each person making edits to the survey. When you share a survey, it is available in the **Shared with me** section on the home page.

<!--note from editor:  In below sentence, change "Microsoft Forms" to "Forms Pro" if that is accurate. -->

Microsoft Forms also displays contributor icons next to each section currently being edited.

1.  Open the survey you want to share for collaboration.

2.  On the **Create Questions** tab, select **Share** from the toolbar at the top of the page.

    ![share the survey](media/share-survey.png "Share the survey")  

3.  Select **Get a link to view and edit**.

    ![get the link to share the survey for collaboration](media/get-survey-share-link.png "Get the link to share the survey for collaboration")  

4.  Select **Copy** next to the text box that displays a survey URL.

    ![link to share the survey for collaboration](media/survey-share-link.png "Link to share the survey for collaboration")  

5.  Share this link with your intended audience.
