# Get started with Microsoft Forms Pro

Microsoft Forms Pro allows you to create and send survey forms to your customers and collect their valuable feedback about your products or services. With Forms Pro, you create and distribute surveys and store survey responses in Dynamics 365 along with other Dynamics 365 data. You can also create polls and easily see results as they come in. When you create a survey or poll, you can invite others to respond to it using any web browser, even on mobile devices. As results are submitted, you can use built-in analytics to evaluate responses.

The first step is to [sign in](sign-in.md) using any web browser or even mobile devices.  

**Notes**:

-   In this preview, Forms Pro is supported in English locale only. Please ensure that your browser language is set to English. More languages will be added in the subsequent releases.

-   You might see forms that are created by using Office Forms. It is recommended to use Office Forms to work with your previous forms.
