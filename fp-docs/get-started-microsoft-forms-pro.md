# Get started with Microsoft Forms Pro

Use Forms Pro to create and send survey forms to your customers and collect valuable feedback about your products and services. You can store survey responses in Dynamics 365 along with other Dynamics 365 data. 

You can also create polls and easily see results as they come in. When you create a survey or poll, you can invite others to respond to it using any web browser, even on mobile devices. As results are submitted, you can use built-in analytics to evaluate responses.

The first step is to [sign in](sign-in.md) using any web browser or mobile device.  

<!--note from editor:  Suggest a change to first bullet item in Note:
In this preview, Forms Pro is available only in an English-language version. Please ensure that your browser language is set to English. More languages will be supported in subsequent releases."

<!--note from editor:  2nd bullet item in note is a little unclear to me. Is this to referring to forms that users might already have on their computer? Change to something like "If you have existing documents that were created with Office Forms, we recommend that you do not make any updates to them using Forms Pro."
Also--In existing documentation I find references to Microsoft Forms (a part of Office 365 Education) but not a product called Office Forms.

> [!NOTE]
