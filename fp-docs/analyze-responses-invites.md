# Analyze responses and invitations

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

Microsoft Forms Pro includes rich, real-time analytics from Power BI to provide summary information and individual results for surveys. It also displays survey insights to help you understand response patterns. You can export the results to Excel for more in-depth analysis, and delete the responses and invitations.

In this section, you'll learn how to:

- [View summary information for your survey](view-summary-information.md)  
- [View details for each question](view-details-each-question.md)  
- [Analyze survey invitations](analyze-survey-invitations.md)  
- [Analyze survey responses](analyze-survey-responses.md)  
- [Analyze survey insights](analyze-survey-insights.md)
