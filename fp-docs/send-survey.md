# Send a survey to get responses

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

After your survey is ready, send it to your respondents and collect their feedback. You can send your survey in the following ways:

- **Email**: Send the survey link by using the built-in email capability.

- **Microsoft Flow**: Configure a business trigger by using [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/) to send the email.  

- **Embed**: Embed the survey in a webpage.

- **Link**: Copy a link to the survey that you created, and paste it into a shared area.

- **QR code**: Send a QR code for your survey.

Respondents can submit responses using a desktop or mobile web browser. You can choose options that allow anyone to submit responses or that restrict responses to only people within your organization.
