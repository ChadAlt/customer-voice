# Upgrade to latest Common Data Service for Apps

Forms Pro doesn't work with the legacy version of Common Data Service (CDS). If your default environment is created with legacy CDS, your environment will not be provisioned and an error message is displayed. You must upgrade the legacy CDS to use the newer version of CDS for Apps. For more information on upgrading to CDS for Apps, see [Upgrade to Common Data Service for Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-service/upgradecds/introduction-upgrade-cds).

To delete or upgrade your CDS from previous version to the newer version, contact your Global administrator. If you want to set up a new environment for Forms Pro, contact support.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you upgrade the CDS in your default environment only.
