# Collaborate on a survey

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

Multiple people can collaborate on the structure and layout of a survey. To share a survey with others who you want to collaborate with, you create a special collaborators link that allows other people to view and make changes to the design of a survey you started.

All contributors to your survey can also view, edit, and delete responses and share the survey with others by sending them the survey collaborators link. Contributors can also distribute surveys via survey email.

In this section, you'll learn how to:
