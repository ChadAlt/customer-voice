# Collaborate on a survey

Multiple people can collaborate on the structure and layout of a survey. To share a survey with others who you want to collaborate with, you create a special collaborators link that allows other people to view and make changes to the design of a survey you started.

All contributors to your survey can also view, edit, and delete responses and share the survey with others by sending them the survey collaborators link. Contributors can also distribute surveys via survey email.

In this section, you'll learn how to:

- [Share a survey for collaborating](share-survey-collaborate.md)  
- [Share a survey as a template](share-survey-template.md)
