# Choose environment

An environment is a space to store, manage, and share your organizationâ€™s business data, apps, and flows. They also serve as containers to separate apps that may have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences. More information: [Environments overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/environments-overview)

When you sign in to Microsoft Forms Pro, only the surveys that are available in the selected environment are displayed. When you create a survey, the survey is connected to the selected environment and is not available in other environments. The invitations and responses are stored in the same environment in which the survey is created. When you copy a survey to another environment, only the survey and its branching rules are copied. The invitations, responses, and associated flows are not copied.

By default, all environments under the tenant you are signed in are displayed. You can switch the environment as per your requirement and start working in it.
