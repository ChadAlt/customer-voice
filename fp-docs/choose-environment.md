# Choose environment

An environment is a space to store, manage, and share your organizationâ€™s business data, apps, and flows. They also serve as containers to separate apps that may have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences. More information: [Environments overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/environments-overview)

You can create environments for different purpose. For example, you can create an environment each for survey development, testing, and production. After developing and testing the survey, you can copy the survey to the production environment. 

When you sign in to Microsoft Forms Pro, only the surveys that are available in the selected environment are displayed. When you create a survey, the survey is connected to the selected environment and is not available in other environments. The invitations and responses are stored in the same environment in which the survey is created. When you copy a survey to another environment, only the survey and its branching rules are copied. The invitations, responses, and associated flows are not copied to another environment.

To work with surveys in an environment, you must install the Microsoft Forms Pro app from Microsoft AppSource and assign the Survey User role to the users. If you switch to an environment that doesn't have Microsoft Forms Pro, an error is displayed.

## Change an environment

By default, all environments under the tenant you are signed in are displayed. You can switch the environment as per your requirement and start working in it.
To change an environment:

1. Select your user name from the upper-right corner of the page.
2. A list of environments are displayed under the **Environments** section.
3. Select the required environment.

## Copy survey to another environment
