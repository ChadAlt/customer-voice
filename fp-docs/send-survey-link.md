# Send a survey link to others

If you don’t have the email addresses of the people you want to view your survey, or if you don’t want to use email for this purpose, you can easily copy a custom link that lets you send your survey to others.

1.  Open the survey you want to send and go to **Send Survey** &gt; **Link**.

2.  Select **Copy** and then paste this link wherever your intended audience can see and click it to gain access to your survey.
