# Send a survey link to others

If you don't have the email addresses of the people who you want to view your survey, or if you don't want to use the built-in email composer for this purpose, you can easily copy a custom link that lets you send your survey to others.

> [!NOTE]
> The survey link generated is a non-personalized link. You won't be able to record the respondent's name and whether the respondent has submitted only one response if you select **Anyone with the link can respond** in [survey settings](invite-settings.md).

1. Open the survey you want to send, and then select **Send** from the toolbar at the top of the page.

2. Select **Link**.

3. Select **Copy**, and then paste the provided link to a place visible to your intended audience. They can select the link to gain access to your survey.
