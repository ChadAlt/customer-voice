# Change an environment

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

By default, all environments under the tenant you're signed in to are displayed. To change an environment:

1. Sign in to Microsoft Forms Pro.

2. Select **Environment** in the upper-right corner of the page to display a list of environments.

3. Select the environment you want.
