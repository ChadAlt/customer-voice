# Work with Microsoft Forms Pro Trial

Microsoft Forms Pro is generally available on July 1, 2019. With the general availability of Microsoft Forms Pro, the participants of the Preview Program will be converted into the trial users and they'll enjoy the full functionality of Microsoft Forms Pro until July 30, 2019. The trial version of Forms Pro will expire after July 30, 2019. 

If you or your users wish to continue using Microsoft Forms Pro after July 30, 2019, a license must be purchased. If you choose not to buy a license to Microsoft Forms Pro July 30, 2019:

- Users in your organization will no longer be able to create new surveys or receive survey responses using Microsoft Forms Pro.  
- Users in your organization with access to Microsoft Forms via a qualifying Office 365 license will revert from Microsoft Forms Pro to Microsoft Forms.

If you did not participate in the Preview Program, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial starting July 01, 2019. After the trial period, you'll require a paid license to continue creating new surveys or receiving survey responses using Microsoft Forms Pro.

For information on purchasing Forms Pro, see [Purchase Microsoft Forms Pro](purchase.md).

## Opt out of trial

You can always opt out of Microsoft Forms Pro trial manually as per your requirement. For information on opting out, see [Opt out of Forms Pro](administer.md#opt-out-of-forms-pro).

> [!NOTE]
> If you opt out of Forms Pro trial and sign up again at a later date, your trial end date will be counted from the first date you signed in.

Your trial experience can also be downgraded in the following scenarios:

- Trial license is expired
- Full license is expired
- License is removed by an administrator

When your trial experience is downgraded, a message is displayed with an option to export your survey responses. Your survey will also stop receiving responses if you don't have a valid license.

If you don't purchase a license, you data is retained for 90 days, and then deleted thereafter.
