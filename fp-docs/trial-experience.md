## Opt out of trial

You can always opt out of the Microsoft Forms Pro trial manually. For information about opting out, see [Opt out of Forms Pro](administer.md#opt-out-of-forms-pro).

> [!NOTE]
> If you opt out of the Microsoft Forms Pro trial and sign up again later, your trial end date will be counted from the first date you signed in.

Your trial experience may also be downgraded in the following scenarios:

- Trial license is expired
- An administrator removed your license

When your trial experience is downgraded, a message is displayed with an option to export your survey responses. Your survey will also stop receiving responses if you don't have a valid license. 

If you don't purchase a license, you data is retained for 90 days, and then deleted.
