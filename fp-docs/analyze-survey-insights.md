# Analyze survey insights

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

When there are sufficient responses to a survey, insights are generated to show a correlation between the questions and sentiments of the respondents. To see a summary of the insights, go to **Responses** &gt; **Overview**. The summary is displayed under **Latest insights**.

To view detailed survey insights, select **View all**. The following insights are displayed:

- **Association insights**: Displays the correlation between one or more questions in the survey. This helps an organization detect patterns in the responders. These patterns help organizations get a better understanding of their customers.

- **Sentiment insights**: Displays the average sentiment score and a word cloud for positive and negative feedback of respondents. Sentiment score is calculated based on the sentiment of the responses to the text-based questions. The word cloud is created from key phrases in the feedback.
