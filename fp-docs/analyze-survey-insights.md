When there are sufficient responses to a survey, insights are generated to show a correlation between the questions and sentiments of the respondents. To see a summary of the insights, **Responses** &gt; **Overview**. The summary is displayed under **Latest insights**.

To view detailed survey insights, select **View all**. The following insights are displayed:

- **Association insights**: Displays the correlation between one or more questions in the survey. This helps an organization detect patterns in the responders. These patterns help organizations get a better understanding of their customers.

- **Sentiment insights**: Displays the average sentiment score and a word cloud for positive and negative feedback of respondents. Sentiment score is calculated based on the sentiment of the responses to the text-based questions. The word cloud is created from key phrases in the feedback.
