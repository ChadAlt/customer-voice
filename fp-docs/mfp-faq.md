# Microsoft Forms Pro FAQ

We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and provided brief answers to help you get to your information quickly.

## I'm unable to work with group forms in Microsoft Forms Pro.

Group forms aren't currently supported in Microsoft Forms Pro.

## How is the owner of a survey response determined?

A response owner is determined by the following logic:

- For responses to a survey invitation, the invitation owner is set as the response owner.
- If the survey invitation owner doesn't have sufficient privileges to own responses, or if the response is anonymous, the survey owner is set as the response owner.
- If the account of a survey owner has been disabled or the survey owner is unable to access the application due to licensing issues, the application user is set as the response owner.

## I deleted data from Common Data Service but it is visible in reports.

It is recommended not to delete Forms Pro data directly from Common Data Service. If you delete any data directly from Common Data Service, it is not synchronized with Forms Pro services. If you want to delete any data, you must delete using Forms Pro interface.
