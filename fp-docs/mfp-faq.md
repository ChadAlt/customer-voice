# Microsoft Forms Pro FAQ

We have compiled a list of frequently asked questions and provided brief answers to help you get to your information quickly.

## I'm unable to work with group forms in Microsoft Forms Pro.

Group forms aren't currently supported in Microsoft Forms Pro.

## How is the owner of a survey response determined?

All responses are created by the Forms Pro application user impersonating the response owner. A response owner is determined by the following logic:
- For responses to the survey invitation, the invitation owner is set as the response owner.
- If a survey invitation owner does not have sufficient privileges to own responses, or if response is anonymous, the survey owner is set as the response owner.
- If a survey owner is disabled or unable to access the application due to license issues, the application user is set as the response owner.
