# Microsoft Forms Pro FAQ

We have compiled a list of frequently asked questions and provided brief answers to help you get to your information quickly.

## I'm unable to work with group forms in Microsoft Forms Pro.

Group forms are not supported currently in Microsoft Forms Pro.

## I'm unable to change ownership of a survey.

You cannot change the ownership of a survey in Microsoft Forms Pro. However, if an employee (survey owner) has left the organization, the survey ownership can be changed by an administrator within 30 days.

1. In the address bar of your browser, enter `https://forms.office.com/FormsPro/Pages/delegatepage.aspx?originalowner=[_Azure Active Directory ID_]`. A page opens containing surveys owned by the user who has left the organization.

  > [!NOTE]
  > _Azure Active Directory ID_ is the object ID of the user who has left the organization.

2. On the survey you want to change the ownership, select **More form actions** (...) in the upper-right corner of the survey tile, and then select **Move**.

3. From the right pane, assign the survey to yourself.
