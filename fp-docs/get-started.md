# Get started with Forms Pro

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Forms Pro has evolved into Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, providing you with additional survey capabilities and business benefits. The change is being introduced in phases and will be available in all geographical regions in the next few weeks, except for US Government Community Cloud customers. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice will be available on US Government Community Cloud by October 2020. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2128357) documentation.

Microsoft Forms Pro is an enterprise survey capability that helps businesses obtain the feedback they need to make smarter decisions. Powered by both Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, Forms Pro supports businesses seeking to transform customer, product, and employee experiences.

Forms Pro is built on Microsoft Forms, and it offers new capabilities that make capturing and analyzing customer and employee feedback simpler than ever. Your customers can respond to the surveys by using any web browser or mobile device. As the responses are submitted, analyze them with Power BI reports and make effective decisions accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> If Microsoft Forms is disabled for a user, Forms Pro will also be disabled.

Forms Pro has robust tooling to support deeper analytics and insights with integration across your tools, such as Common Data Service, Microsoft Power Platform, and the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. With Forms Pro, you can send your customers branded surveys that have your company's look and feel. Survey distribution is simpler with the built-in email composer. You can also automate sending surveys by using Microsoft Power Automate and leverage preconfigured flow templates to integrate with the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365.

Use Forms Pro to work with classic forms and quizzes, and create new ones. The classic forms and quizzes open in their respective interfaces within the Forms Pro environment. This gives you the ability to work with surveys and classic forms together. For information about how to create classic forms in Forms Pro, see [Create a classic form](create-classic-form.md).

## Web browsers that work with Forms Pro

Forms Pro is optimized for the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Microsoft Forms Pro trial

Microsoft Forms Pro in now Dynamics 365 Customer Voice and will be generally available by end of August 2020. You can sign up for the trial after Dynamics 365 Customer Voice is generally available.

If you are an existing Forms Pro user, use [https://forms.office.com](https://forms.office.com) to sign in to Forms Pro. To purchase Forms Pro licenses, see [Purchase Microsoft Forms Pro](purchase.md).

## Forms Pro availability on US Government Community Cloud

The dependency services used by Forms Pro are available on US Government Community Cloud (GCC). Forms Pro is built on top of Microsoft Forms, so the [limitations of Microsoft Forms features on GCC](https://support.office.com/article/microsoft-forms-features-for-u-s-government-community-cloud-gcc-gcc-high-and-dod-environments-5cbd407a-eef7-431e-8e3a-eb666eab4b4c?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) hold true. In addition to those, note the following differences in functionality for Forms Pro on GCC:

- The format of survey responses on the **Responses** tab is slightly different when compared to non-GCC regions. The report can only display up to 50,000 responses. You can create a Power BI report and connect directly to Common Data Service to see all the responses.

- By default, the anonymous sharing of surveys is disabled. A tenant administrator must enable anonymous sharing by selecting the **Send a link to the form and collect responses** check box under **External sharing** in the Microsoft 365 admin center. More information: [Administrator settings for Microsoft Forms](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/administrator-settings-for-microsoft-forms-48161c55-fbae-4f37-8951-9e3befc0248b)

- Microsoft Forms Pro on GCC uses your Microsoft Exchange mailbox to send the survey. For information about Exchange mailbox limits, see [Exchange Online limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits).

> [!NOTE]
> As a GCC customer, you must either have a Dynamics 365 enterprise license or a Microsoft 365 license.
