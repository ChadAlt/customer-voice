# Get started with Forms Pro

Microsoft Forms Pro is an enterprise survey capability that helps businesses obtain the feedback they need to make smarter decisions. Powered by both Office 365 and Dynamics 365, Forms Pro supports businesses seeking to transform customer, product, and employee experiences.Â 

Forms Pro is built on Microsoft Forms, and it offers new capabilities that make capturing and analyzing customer and employee feedback simpler than ever. Your customers can respond to the surveys using any web browser or mobile device. As the responses are submitted, analyze them with Power BI reports and make effective decisions accordingly.

## Web browsers that work with Forms Pro

Forms Pro is optimized for the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Sign up for the Microsoft Forms Pro trial

Microsoft Forms Pro is generally available on July 1, 2019. To try Forms Pro, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial. After the trial period, you will need a paid license to continue using Microsoft Forms Pro. For information about purchasing Forms Pro, see [Purchase Microsoft Forms Pro](purchase.md).

1. Open [https://formspro.microsoft.com](https://formspro.microsoft.com/) in a web browser.

2. Select **Get started**.

3. Enter your email address and follow the wizard to complete the sign-up process.

   > [!NOTE]
   > - A work or school account is required for trying Forms Pro.
   > - Users who participated in the Microsoft Forms Pro public preview program are automatically converted into the 30-day trial until July 30, 2019.  

### Opt out of trial

You can always opt out of the Microsoft Forms Pro trial manually. For information about opting out, see [Opt out of Forms Pro](administer.md#opt-out-of-forms-pro).

> [!NOTE]
> If you opt out of the Microsoft Forms Pro trial and sign up again later, your trial end date will be counted from the first date you signed in.

Your trial experience may also be downgraded in the following scenarios:

- Trial license is expired
- An administrator removed your license

When your trial experience is downgraded, a message is displayed with an option to export your survey responses. Your survey will also stop receiving responses if you don't have a valid license. Your data is retained for 90 days, and then deleted if you don't purchase a license before the expiry of trial.
