Microsoft Forms Pro is an enterprise survey capability that helps businesses obtain the feedback they need to make smarter decisions. Powered by both Office 365 and Dynamics 365, Microsoft Forms Pro supports businesses seeking to transform customer, product and employee experiences, as well as other survey needs.Â 

You can create and send surveys to your customers and collect their valuable feedback about your products and services. Your customers can respond to the surveys using any web browser, even on mobile devices. As the responses are submitted,  analyze them by using powerful Power BI reports and take effective decisions accordingly.

### Web browsers with which Microsoft Forms Pro works

Microsoft Forms Pro is optimized for latest versions of Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Plan to create a survey

It's important to have a plan for configuring your surveys. Here are a few things to think about when you are creating questions:

-   How do you want to collaborate? For example, do you want to share the survey as a template or invite other people to collaborate?

-   What's the purpose of your survey? For example, you might want to interact with your customers, promote new products or services, or measure customer satisfaction. If your goal is to measure something, what and how do you want to measure it?

-   How long do you want the survey to be? Keep in mind that longer surveys tend to have higher abandon rates. A good rule of thumb is to keep surveys shorter than five minutes, or no longer than 10 questions (depending on the type of questions you ask).

-   How many mandatory questions are to be included in the survey? We recommend that you ask as few mandatory questions as possible.

-   How do you want to distribute your survey? For example, do you want to distribute it through individual email, QR code, or do you want to automate?

## Best practices for creating a survey

A few best practices enable you to create a meaningful survey and gather good responses from your customers. You can then analyze those responses and act on them in a way that best suits your organization. Some of the best practices for creating a survey are:

- **Define an objective**: Having an objective allows you to properly plan for your survey. It also allows you to identify what results you expect from your customers. Knowing how you will use the responses helps you pick the right questions for your survey.

- **Keep the survey short**: If you create a survey that takes a long time to complete, you might reduce your response rate.

- **Create a logical flow of questions**: Ensure that your survey has a logical flow of questions to keep the respondents interested in the survey.

- **Organize the survey**: Group related questions together.

- **Preview the survey**: After creating your survey, always preview it to check the overall flow of the survey and to catch any mistakes.

- **Mention expectations in the survey invitation**: In the survey invitation, be sure to mention the estimated time to complete it and give a brief overview. This will help respondents submit their input within the expected time frame.
