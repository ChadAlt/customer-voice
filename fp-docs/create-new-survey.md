# Create a new survey

To create a new survey with Forms Pro:

1.	Sign in to Forms Pro with your Office 365 credentials.

2.	Under **My Forms**, select **New Pro Survey**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![New survey](media/new-survey-button.png "New survey") 

3.	Select the default survey name, and enter a name for your survey. You can also enter an optional description for it.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Add survey title and description](media/survey-title.png "Add survey title and description") 

4.	Select **Add new** to view question types that can be added to your survey. You can choose from **Choice**, **Text**, **Rating**, or **Date** questions. You can also select **More** (...), and choose **Ranking**, **Likert**, or **Net Promoter Score** questions.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Question types](media/ques-types.png "Question types") 

5.	Select the required question type(s) to be added.

6.	Enter the question text and its answer options. The survey is saved automatically.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Survey](media/survey.png "Survey") 

7. Optionally, apply formatting to the survey elements, such as survey heading, survey description, question text, and question subtitle. More information: [Format text in a survey](survey-text-format.md).

8. To change the order of questions in the survey, select the question and then select the up or down arrows on the right side of each question to move them up or down.

9. To hide a question from being displayed in the survey, move the **Visible** toggle to off position. By default, this option is turned on. You can show the question to the responder based on a branching rule. More information: [Create a branching rule](create-branching-rule.md).

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Question visibility](media/visibility-option.png "Question visibility") 

> [!NOTE]
> - You can personalize your survey by adding custom data to the questions. More information: [Personalize a survey](personalize-survey.md).
> - You can create a classic form within Microsoft Forms Pro. More information: [Create a classic form](create-classic-form.md).
> - You can also create quizzes within Microsoft Forms Pro to get real-time feedback. For steps to create a quiz, see: [Create a quiz with Microsoft Forms](https://support.office.com/article/create-a-quiz-with-microsoft-forms-a082a018-24a1-48c1-b176-4b3616cdc83d).

## Proactive phishing prevention

Phishing attacks attempt to steal sensitive information through emails, websites, text messages, or other forms of electronic communication that often look to be official communication from legitimate companies or individuals. The information that phishers attempt to steal can be passwords or other credentials.

In Microsoft Forms Pro, we enable automated machine reviews to proactively detect malicious password collection in surveys.

### Survey designer experience

While designing a survey if you ask any questions that requires a respondent to provide password, account information, or other security information, the survey is automatically blocked and can't be distributed. The administrator receives a notification and an option to unblock the survey. If you want to distribute the survey, you must contact your administrator to unblock it.

### Administrator experience

When a survey is blocked automatically, the administrator receives a daily notification in **Message center** with an option to unblock the survey. For information on how to unblock a survey, see [Review and unblock forms detected and blocked for potential phishing](https://support.office.com/article/review-and-unblock-forms-detected-and-blocked-for-potential-phishing-879a90d7-6ef9-4145-933a-fb53a430bced).
