7. Optionally, apply formatting to the survey elements, such as survey heading, survey description, question text, and question subtitle. More information: [Format text in a survey](survey-text-format.md).

8. To change the order of questions in the survey, select the question and then select the up or down arrows on the right side of each question to move them up or down.

9. To hide a question from being displayed in the survey, move the **Visible** toggle to off position. By default, this option is turned on. You can show the question to the responder based on a branching rule. More information: [Create a branching rule](create-branching-rule.md).
