## Upload contacts from a CSV file

You can upload a maximum of 10,000 contacts by using a CSV file. You can also use this file to associate a survey invitation and response to an entity in Common Data Service. To upload contacts, you must first [create the CSV file](#create-a-csv-file) and then [upload the CSV file](#upload-a-csv-file).

<a name="create-a-csv-file"></a>

### Create the CSV file

## Insert a survey link

The survey link is added to your email message by default. To insert the survey link in a different location in your email message, place the cursor at the location you want, and then select **Insert** > **Survey link**. You can also select text, and then select **Insert** > **Survey link** to display that text as the survey link.

<a name="unsubscribe-from-a-survey"></a>

## Insert an unsubscribe link

You can configure your email message to include a link that allows a respondent to unsubscribe from the survey. To insert the unsubscribe link in the email message, place the cursor at the required location, and then select **Insert** > **Unsubscribe link**. You can also select text, and then select **Insert** > **Unsubscribe link** to display that text as the unsubscribe link. By default, the unsubscribe link is added to all email message templates.

<a name="personalize-an-email"></a>

## Personalize the survey email

You can use variables to personalize your survey email&mdash;for example, you can add the respondent's first name. Place the cursor where you want the name to appear, select **Personalize**, and then select **First Name** from the list. A placeholder is added at the cursor location. The first name of the respondent is automatically inserted when the email is sent. All variables created in a survey are displayed in the **Personalize** list.

To create a new variable, select **New variable** from the **Personalize** list. If default values haven't been defined for survey variables, nothing is displayed for the variables. For more information about creating variables and providing values for them, see [Personalize a survey](personalize-survey.md).

<a name="embed-survey-in-an-email"></a>

## Embed a survey in an email

If you have added a Choice (single answer), Rating (star or smiley symbol), or Net Promoter Score question as the first question in your survey, you can embed it in your email message. To embed the question, place the cursor where you want to embed the question, and then select **Embed survey question**. The question is embedded at the cursorâ€™s location and the email message is adjusted accordingly. When a responder selects an option to answer the question, the whole survey is opened in a web browser and the responder can continue with completing the survey.

![Embed question in an email](media/embed-ques-email.png "Embed question in an email")

> [!NOTE]
> - You can't embed a question in an email if you've enabled question shuffling in the survey.
> - If you want to send an embedded survey in an email through Power Automate, you must embed the question in an email and save it as a new email template. While configuring a flow, you must select the new email template. More information: [Use email templates](#use-email-templates)

If you've created a multilingual survey, you can use survey variables to set the default locale for displaying the survey. To set the default locale, open the **Variables** panel, and then specify a value for the **locale** variable. The value must be a language code, for example **en** or **fr**.

<a name="use-email-templates"></a>

## Use email templates

You can use an email template&mdash;a preformatted email message&mdash;to quickly create and send email messages. If you create a survey from the blank template, **Default Template** is selected for use in an email message. If you've created a project from one of the out-of-the-box templates, the corresponding email template is selected by default.

> [!NOTE]
> You can save a maximum of 10 email templates.

### Create a new email template

1. In the email editor, select **Template** > **Create new**.

2. In the **Create new template** dialog box, enter a name for the template.

3. From the **Template** list, select the newly created template.

4. Modify the email message, and then select **Save**.

### Import an email template from other surveys

You can import an email template from other surveys in the same or a different project.

1. In the email editor, select **Template** > **Import from** > **Surveys**.

2. Select a either the current project or any other project, select the survey, and then select **Next**.

3. Select a template, and then select **Import**.

### Import a personal email template

If you've been transitioned from Forms Pro, your email templates from Forms Pro are migrated as personal templates in Dynamics 365 Customer Voice. You can then import the required templates in your surveys.

1. In the email editor, select **Template** > **Import from** > **My templates**.

2. Select a template, and then select **Import**.

### Create multilingual email templates

By default, the email template is created in the default language of the survey. If you've added languages to your survey, you can create email template in those languages, and send email in the customer preferred languages. This creates versions of an email template in the selected languages.

1. In the email editor, select **Language** > **Add language**.

2. Select the languages in which you want to create email template.

3. From the **Language** list, select a language, and update the email message in the selected language.

4. Select **Save**.

5. Repeat step 3 through 4 to update email message for all the added languages.

To send survey invitation in a language other than the default, select an email template and the required language, and then send the email.

If you're using Power Automate to send survey invitations, specify the locale in the **Language** field. If an email template is created in the specified language, the survey invitation is sent in the specified language. Otherwise, the survey invitation is sent in the default language.

## Format email messages

You can format your email message by using the formatting toolbar at the bottom of the email editor. The formatting toolbar allows you to add formatting to your text, add table and images to your email message, and much more. You can also view the HTML source of your email message and modify the HTML code directly.
