3. Update the branding options as described in the following sections.

## Theme color

You can select a color that will be applied to various survey elements such as survey header, question area, background, footer, and buttons. This allows you to customize your survey's theme and match it with your company's theme.

To select a theme color for your survey, expand the **Theme color** section, and do either of the following:

- Select the default color to open a color picker and then choose a color.
