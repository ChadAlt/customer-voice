# Add branding to a survey

You can customize the appearance of your survey to match your company's branding. This includes changing the color, font, background image, or uploading a custom CSS file.

**To add branding to a survey**

1. Open the survey in which you want to add branding.

2. On the **Design** tab, select **Customization** at the right-side of the page, and then select **Branding**.

3. Update the branding options as described in the following sections.

## Theme color

You can select a color that will be applied to various survey elements such as survey header, question area, background, footer, and buttons. This allows you to customize your survey's theme and match it with your company's theme.

To select a theme color for your survey, do either of the following:
- Select the default color to open a color picker and then choose a color.
- Enter a hex code in the **HEX #** field.

## Fonts

You can select a font that will be applied to the survey header and body elements.

To select survey level fonts, choose values for the following:
- **Header font**: Font chosen from this list is applied to the survey header, survey description, section header, and section description. By default, the header font is Segoe UI.
- **Body font**: Font chosen from this list is applied to the questions, answer options, button labels, header text, and footer text. By default, the body font is Segoe UI.

You can also change font style, font size, and color of the text of individual elements of the survey. More information: [Format text in a survey](survey-text-format.md)
