# Send a survey to get responses

After your survey is ready, go to the **Send** tab, and send it to your respondents for collecting their feedback. You can send your survey in the following ways:

- **Email**: Send the survey link by using the built-in email capability.

- **Power Automate**: Configure a business trigger by using [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/) to send the email.  
- **Embed**: Embed the survey in a webpage.

- **Link**: Copy a link to the survey that you created, and paste it into a shared area.

- **QR code**: Send a QR code for your survey.

Respondents can submit responses by using a desktop or mobile web browser. You can choose to allow anyone to submit responses or restrict responses only to people within your organization.
