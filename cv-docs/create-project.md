# Create a project

A project is a container that consists of surveys, satisfaction metrics, Power Automate flows, and reports. You can create, distribute, and analyze a survey by creating a project. A project can be created by using one of the ready-to-use project templates or from scratch by using a blank template.

Customer Voice offers ready-to-use feedback project templates that include survey questions, workflows, and relevant reports. Each project template includes industry best-practice survey questions and pre-configured satisfaction metrics and workflows for Dynamics 365 business applications. The available project templates are:

- **Customer pulse**: The customer pulse template is based on Forrester Research customer experience (CX) best practices and includes questions to collect customer sentiment at regular intervals.

- **Order delivery**: The Order delivery template allows you to collect timely feedback after an order is delivered. It also includes a workflow to automate sending a survey after an order is complete. The survey is sent to the customer and the response is automatically integrated with the order and customer records.

- **Service visit**: The Service visit template allows you to collect timely feedback following a customer visit scheduled with the Dynamics 365 Field Service application. The feedback is automatically integrated to the customer visit record in Dynamics 365, get insights including trends and specific follow-up actions to make sure customer issues are addressed in a timely manner.

- **Support**: The Support template provides an out-of-the-box end-to-end solution for measuring customer satisfaction for your Dynamics 365 case management process. The template includes typical questions and setup needed for the customer service scenario.

- **Blank**: The Blank template allows you to create a survey from scratch and configure it as per your requirements. This will not contain any pre-configured survey questions, workflows, and satisfaction metrics.
