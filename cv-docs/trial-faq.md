# Trial FAQ

We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions related to trial and provided brief answers to help you get to your information quickly.

## What are the system requirements for the trial?

This app is a cloud-based service that does not require special software other than an up-to-date web browser, though some restrictions apply. [Learn more about web application requirements](/power-platform/admin/web-application-requirements)

## How do I add more users to a trial?

To add users, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) using the trial admin account. Follow the [admin center guidance](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add users up to the trial license limit.

## How do I extend the trial?

## What features are available in the trial?
