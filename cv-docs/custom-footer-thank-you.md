# Customize footer text and thank-you message

Footer text is displayed at the bottom of every page in a survey. Thank-you message is displayed to the respondents after a survey is submitted. A default content is available for both the footer text and thank-you message. However, you can add your own content, as per your requirement, by customizing them.

You can also add formatting to the footer text and thank-you message by changing their font style, font size, and color. You can also add a link to the message by selecting the **Link** button on the formatting toolbar, and then adding the link through the link editor. More information: [Format text in a survey](survey-text-format.md)
