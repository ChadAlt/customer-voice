## Experience for a trial or new user

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice uses a Microsoft Dataverse environment to store and manage data. Provisioning an environment typically takes 15 to 60 minutes to complete. While an environment is getting provisioned, some functionality isn't available, but you can perform minimal operations and explore the product. After the environment is provisioned, all functionality becomes available. More information: [What is Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) and [Environments overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/environments-overview)

This section lists all the functionality that will be restricted until an environment is provisioned. The restricted experience applies:

- Only for the default environment.
- Only for the trial users and the users who purchase Dynamics 365 Customer Voice through Web Direct.
- Only when you sign in for the first time before an environment is provisioned.

**What can you do while an environment is getting provisioned?**

- See a preview of the out-of-the-box project templates.
- Create a project by using the **Blank** project template.
- Create new surveys within a project.
- Preview a survey.
- View reports (as read-only).
- Select links such as content, videos, and blogs on the **Home** tab.

**What are you unable to do while an environment is getting provisioned?**

- Send your surveys through email or Power Automate.
- Choose or modify email templates.
- Submit responses while previewing a survey.
- Configure satisfaction metrics.
- Perform actions such as copy, delete, or rename projects and surveys.
