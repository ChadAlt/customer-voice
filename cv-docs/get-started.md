# Get started with Dynamics 365 Customer Voice

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice is an enterprise feedback management application that enables you to easily keep track of the customer metrics that matter the most to your business. With deep integration from the Dynamics 365 line of business (LOB) applications, Customer Voice adds rich insights by feeding real-time survey data into customer records. Customer Voice provides an easy and friction-free experience, from creating surveys, to generating actionable insights based on customer feedback with minimal setup time. It helps you to keep a pulse on what customers value and how they view your products and services, so you can rest assured that your data is supported by Microsoft security and compliance policies.

Customer Voice introduces project management capabilities. A project contains multiple surveys that share common metrics and settings to simplify survey management. When you log in to Customer Voice, you land on the **All projects** tab. The **All projects** tab displays a list of projects created by you, allows you to create new projects, and manage the existing ones. It also displays the survey related data of a project. More information: [Create a project](create-project.md)

There are two more tabs available in Customer Voice: **Home** and **Reports**.

The **Home** tab allows you to create a project, open recently accessed projects, and view satisfaction metrics. It provides a personalized experience, enabling users to collect customer feedback and  get relevant insights quickly and easily all in a few clicks. It also includes tips and tricks to help you get started and learn more of the application.

The **Reports** tab allows you to view satisfaction metric dashboard and responses to your surveys. More information: [Work with reports](about-reports.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Customer Voice is not available on US Government Community Cloud (GCC).

### Experience for a trial or new user

Customer Voice uses Common Data Service to store and manage data. However, the provisioning and setup of Common Data Service typically takes 15 to 60 minutes to complete. While Common Data Service is getting provisioned, a few functionalities are not available. But, you can perform the minimum operations and explore the product without seeing any failures.
