# Get started with Dynamics 365 Customer Voice

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice is an enterprise feedback management application that enables you to easily keep track of the customer metrics that matter the most to your business. With deep integration from the Dynamics 365 line of business (LOB) applications, Customer Voice adds rich insights by feeding real-time survey data into customer records. Customer Voice provides an easy and friction-free experience, from creating surveys, to generating actionable insights based on customer feedback with minimal setup time. It helps you to keep a pulse on what customers value and how they view your products and services, so you can rest assured that your data is supported by Microsoft security and compliance policies.

When you log in to Customer Voice, you land on the **All projects** tab. The **All projects** tab displays a list of projects created by you, allows you to create new projects, and manage the existing ones. It also displays the survey related data of a project. More information: [About projects](about-projects.md)

There are two more tabs available in Customer Voice: **Home** and **Reports**.

The **Home** tab allows you to create a project, open recently accessed projects, and view satisfaction metrics. It provides a personalized experience, enabling users to collect customer feedback and  get relevant insights quickly and easily all in a few clicks. It also includes tips and tricks to help you get started and learn more of the application.

The **Reports** tab allows you to view satisfaction metric dashboard and responses to your surveys. More information: [Work with reports](about-reports.md)

## Transition from Forms Pro

With the release of Customer Voice on July 21, 2020, all your surveys from Forms Pro will be moved to Customer Voice and you'll be able to perform all the actions in Customer Voice that you were doing in Forms Pro. 

All your surveys from Forms Pro are migrated as individual projects in Customer Voice. This means, each project will contain one survey. You can see all your projects on the **All projects** tab.

If you have a shared survey in Forms Pro, a shared project will be created with the survey shared.

If you have created a flow for your surveys in Forms Pro, they will be available at the survey level in Customer Voice.

If you have added an NPS question or tagged a text question for sentiment analysis, the corresponding NPS and sentiment metrics are created in Customer Voice. A dashboard is automatically created for each set of metrics showcasing recent scores and trends. The dashboard is available under the **Reports** tab in the left-navigation pane.





If you have a Forms Pro license only and try to login to Forms Pro, the following message will be displayed:
