# Survey scoring

This feature gives you the ability to attach a point value to the answers of specific question types. These point values are summed up to give your respondent a final score.

A scored survey is a survey where you assign points or a score to some or all of your answer options. Those points are added up to the surveyâ€™s total score. 

Survey scoring allows you to set a numerical value to each answer. For multiple choice questions you can create several scores reflecting the accuracy of the choice.
