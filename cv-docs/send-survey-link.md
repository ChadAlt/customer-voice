# Send a survey by using link

If you don't have the email addresses of the people from whom you want to collect feedback, or if you don't want to use the built-in email composer for this purpose, you can easily copy a link to your survey. You can then send your survey by pasting the link in an email, on a web page, or in any mode of communication you want to use. The recipients can select the link and complete the survey.

> [!NOTE]
> - The survey link generated is a non-personalized link. You won't be able to record the respondent's name and whether the respondent has submitted only one response if **Only people in my organization can respond** is turned off in [distribution settings](distribution-settings.md).
> - If you've personalized your survey by using variables, they will not be replaced with their values and the variable names are displayed as is because the link is a non-personalized survey link.

**To send a survey by using link**

1. Open the survey and go to the **Send** tab.

2. Select **Link**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you've sent your survey through email once, the invitation summary is displayed. To get your survey's link, select **Resend** > **Link**, and then select **Link**.

3. In the **Link to your survey** pop-up, select **Copy**.
