# View satisfaction metrics report

The satisfaction metrics dashboard is created automatically for each set of metrics, showcasing recent scores and trends. To see the dashboard, open the project, and select **Satisfaction metrics** under the **Reports** section in the left pane.

By default, the data is displayed for all surveys in a project and for all days. You can filter the data displayed in charts by using the date filter and also select a survey for which you want to see the data. The name of the charts are displayed as per the metric name you enter while creating them.

The following charts are displayed for the metrics:

- **Net Promoter Score**: A meter chart shows the score for the metric. The area chart towards the right of the meter chart shows the trend of CSAT score for the selected time period.

- **Sentiment**: A pie chart shows the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments for the metric. The stacked column chart towards the right of the pie chart shows the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment for the selected time period.

- **CSAT**: A meter chart shows the score for the metric. The area chart towards the right of the meter chart shows the trend of CSAT score for the selected time period.
