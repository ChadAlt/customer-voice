# Satisfaction metrics

Organizations use various metrics to determine the effectiveness of the experiences they provide to their customers. A subset of these metrics is tracked by them daily and forms the basis for measuring their performance. These metrics are called satisfaction metrics. In other words, we can say that satisfaction metrics are measurement systems that allow you to measure your customer experience. This ensures that the data you collected through survey responses can be analyzed successfully, and decisions can be made accordingly.

Customer Voice includes support for adding the following standardized satisfaction metrics and mapping them to survey questions:

- **Net Promoter ScoreÂ® (NPS)**:
- **Sentiment**:
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**:

Satisfaction metrics are defined at the project level. If you create a project from one of the ready-to-use project templates, satisfaction metrics are already created and mapped with the questions. But, you can add more metrics as per your requirement. If you create a project from the **Blank** project template, you need to add satisfaction metrics and map with the questions.

After you have received responses to your survey, a dashboard is created automatically for each set of metrics showcasing recent scores and trends. The dashboard is available under the **Reports** tab in the left-navigation pane.
