# Transition from Forms Pro to Customer Voice

With the release of Customer Voice on July 21, 2020, all your surveys from Forms Pro will be moved to Customer Voice and you'll be able to perform all the actions in Customer Voice that you were doing in Forms Pro. The transition period is of 45 days.

## How will the data be migrated?

All your surveys from Forms Pro are migrated as individual projects in Customer Voice. This means, each project will contain one survey. You can see all your projects on the **All projects** tab.

If you have a shared survey in Forms Pro, a shared project will be created with the survey shared.

If you have created a flow for your surveys in Forms Pro, they will be available at the survey level in Customer Voice.

If you have added an NPS question or tagged a text question for sentiment analysis, the corresponding NPS and sentiment metrics are created in Customer Voice. A dashboard is automatically created for each set of metrics showcasing recent scores and trends. The dashboard is available under the **Reports** tab.

If you have created a bookmark for the Forms Pro survey, you'll be redirected to the corresponding project in Customer Voice.

If you are a trial user in Forms Pro, your data is not migrated to Customer Voice.

If a survey is created in the default environment, the data is migrated to the currently available default environment.

## Experience for users based on the license

The transition experience differs based on the product license you have. This section provides details 

**Experience for users with Microsoft Forms Pro license only**
